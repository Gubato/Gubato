My name is Luis Daniel and I'm currently studying to become a Data Analyst.
I'm from Mexico but I can speak english fluently, so no language barrier here!

  - I just finished my Data Analysis bootcamp @TripleTenLatAm and I'm excited to keep growing as a DA. 
  - I'm currently looking for even more data courses and I'm interested in learning R programming.
  - I have interest on any tech stuff and I love videogames (FPS most of all).
  - Most of my code is made with a cup of coffee right beside me.

Hopefully we get to collaborate someday!
