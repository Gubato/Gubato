## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luis Daniel and I'm currently studying to become a Data Analyst.
I'm from Mexico but I can speak english fluently, so no language barrier here!

I'm new to this world of programming, and I'm also really excited to see what I can achieve with some dedication and patience.

Hopefully we get to collaborate someday!
